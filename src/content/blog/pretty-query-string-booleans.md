Beautifying parts of your work is never a bad idea. I just wish that I could remember where I got this idea because it really is a neat one. <!--more-->

Basically, instead of having a URL with a query string like:

```
?var=1
?var=true
```

… the idea is for it to look like:

```
?var=✓
```

I think it's pretty.
