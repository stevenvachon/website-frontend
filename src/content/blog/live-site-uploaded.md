I finished the design and the Flash navigation. It dynamically loads random JPEG images from a directory and fades through them like a slide show. Nothing spectacular, but gives the homepage's header some activity without causing a distraction.

I've started on the ~~Class Reference~~ and I wrote an article today as well, [Flash for the Masses](flash-for-the-masses/index.md). It focuses on CPU and RAM issues with Flash usage.

A lot of the site still doesn't work as I still have to write all the content.
