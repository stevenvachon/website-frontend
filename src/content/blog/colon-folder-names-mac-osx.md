title: Folder Names with a Colon in Mac OS X
---

When it comes to organizing a folder collection of any sort, the folder's name plays a key role in finding your data in the future. One thing that's always bothered me about folders with Windows and Mac was that they restricted me from using the colon character. Call me anal, but when you're dealing with subtitle within subtitle, dashes take slightly longer to read. <!--more-->

Both Windows and Mac use _normal width_ colons to denote drive/directory hierarchy. For this reason, the character cannot be used in folder names. However, Mac allows the use of _full width_ colons. Such can be found in the [Character Palette](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.4/en/mh1064.html) or by copying the character below:

```
ï¼š
```

Unfortunately, while still functioning, the same folder or character in Windows will display an undefined character.
